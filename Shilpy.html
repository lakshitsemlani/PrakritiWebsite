        <h2>Shilpi Rajput</h2>
        <h3>Bilaspur,Chhatisgarh</h3><br>
        <p>Shilpi with just an age of 29 and under a short span of time has done remarkably well in the occupation which was not even her field of study. 
            She was comfortably earning 2 lakh rupees per month in the glamorous TV industry as a designer but she left it because she wanted to return to her roots and do some meaningful work while living with her family. 
            She chose dairy farming and that too indigenous Indian cow because her family personally faced problems related to milk contamination and later got to know about the health risks involved with consuming A1 type milk of HF and jersey breeds. 
            Her initial journey witnessed many ups and downs where she had to literally go and convince people regarding the benefits of A2 milk.  
            Also, she had to personally be involved in all the tasks like milk distribution, be involved in production & processing to ensure quality, etc.
            However, all these processes helped her understand the practical aspects of running an unconventional business but her moral & emotional energy & support from family kept her going.
        </p>
        <p>Now, after working tirelessly for more than 5 years, she has established her A2 milk & milk products business from scratch after working on creating a system in her dairy business, making people aware and introducing innovations, etc. 
            She says that these innovations were introduced because it’s very difficult to earn profit from selling milk and milk products only. So, she had to learn and create a diverse range of products and try them out in the market. 
            Due to these efforts, her production unit is making a diverse range of products with raw material from her Dairy Farm such Gau-Ark, Desi-Ghee, Dhoop-Batti, Diyas  and other decorative articles made by pure desi cow-dung powder are some of the products drawing attention from the market.
        </p>
        <p>While interacting with her & doing further exploration on the topic we got to know many benefits of indigenous cows milk which outweigh the risks of using A1 milk. 
            A2 milk contains A2 Beta Casein, which makes it similar to mother’s milk. It has high levels of Omega 3 that helps in cleaning cholesterol deposits in the blood vessels. 
            The cerebrosides of A2 milk boost brain power and strontium of A2 milk increases our immunity. A2 milk is easier to digest and cures irritable bowel syndrome. 
            Also, A2 milk protein has anti-cancer properties and has the ability to prevent and cure cancer.

        <p>“Along with training women on making milk products, distilled cow urine (gau ark), decorative items, etc. 
            Shilpi also pays attention towards preservation of Indian Desi Cow-breeds as cows which are unable to produce milk are left out in the society. 
            She says that apart from our emotional & ethical reasons to preserve cows we should preserve them because these cows are still helpful for farming and medicinal products.
        </p>

        <p>Due to her management, communication and marketing skills she is able to bring people’s attention towards adopting indigenous cow’s milk, milk products and decorative items/decorative goods for festivals. 
            She says that it’s important to expand the horizon of thought & keep innovating because society responds to a project in unique ways. 
            Initially, she never thought that understanding cultural and religious aspects will also help her sustain the business and produce aesthetically appealing & pure decorative items and idols.  
            Her work in the field has been catching eyes of many experts in the field also. She is being awarded for her achievement from various state and private institutions. 
            Due to her innovations and contribution in employing & training women, she is now acknowledged as a youth icon in the local area.”

        <div class="names">-Report by Siddharth Gupta & Saket Shubham</div><p> (Both of them are BITS Pilani Students, they wrote this report after an online session by Shilpi Ji during 40 day internship program with Prakriti Organics)</p>
        <br>
        <p>“We learnt a lot from her talk regarding entrepreneurship and milk production and consumption related issues. It helped us understand the role of reflection & creativity in a business person’s life. Her story is definitely an inspiration for people engaged in organic farming and preserving/breeding desi cows. We sincerely hope that her story will also inspire many more youth to adopt creative & meaningful approaches in their lives.” – Siddharth & Saket</p>
